# Contributing

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Discussions

All discussions take place on our Slack channel, as noted below:

[Tandemly Slack](https://tandemly.slack.com)

* Use the `dev-eos-wallet` channel to discuss all concerns around this project
* The `project-eos-wallet` channel is to monitor project updates, please refrain from posting here
* Generally any decisions about the design of the project will be documented, check Trello or look for pinned items in the Slack channel

## Reporting Bugs

We are deprecating the use of Github issues in favor of Trello. If you find an issue, post it to the [board](https://trello.com/c/X4P2y40U/12-api-layer).

## Your first contribution

Every contribution to the project starts with a Trello card that's on the board. _Any discussion around an issue or enhancement must be itemized in the form of Trello cards before any work takes place. Not every card will be available to use._

*Please keep in mind:*

  * If you take ownership of a Trello card, be sure to link the PR associated with it
  * Please request at least one reviewer on your PR before merging
  * All dependencies and techniques demonstrated in this demo app should remain uniquely familiar and simple to a broad audience
  * Again, we are not using Github issues

## Releases :point_left: !important

Make sure you are base your branch from develop! We only merge develop into master when we are releasing code releases.
