## Discussions

All discussions take place on our Slack channel, as noted below:

[Tandemly Slack](https://tandemly.slack.com)

* Use the `dev-eos-wallet` channel to discuss all concerns around this project
* The `project-eos-wallet` channel is to monitor project updates, please refrain from posting here
* Generally any decisions about the design of the project will be documented, check Trello or look for pinned items in the Slack channel

## Reporting Bugs

We are deprecating the use of Github issues in favor of Trello. If you find an issue, post it to the [board](https://trello.com/c/X4P2y40U/12-api-layer).

## Your first contribution

Every contribution to the project starts with a Trello card that's on the board. Any discussion around an issue or enhancement must be itemized in the form of Trello cards before any work takes place. Not every card will be available to use.

*Please keep in mind:*

  * If you take ownership of a Trello card, be sure to link the PR associated with it
  * Please request at least one reviewer on your PR before merging
  * All dependencies and techniques demonstrated in this demo app should remain uniquely familiar and simple to a broad audience
  * Again, we are not using Github issues
